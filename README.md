main.nb\percentages:
	this part of code will
	read the data in 
	(Fig.3 ) percentage-data/all;
	(Fig.4 a ) percentage-data/posall-abfix;
	(Fig.4 b) percentage-data/strong-constraints.
	and then analyse each sample to see how many of them are of type A, B, C, D. E...
	
percentage-data is generated by
	compute-v6-gen.py (for Fig.3)
	compute-v8.py (for Fig.4)
		one needs to modify compute-v8.py/setsome(c) to choose between Fig.4 a  and Fig. b.
	
	VfunCPV.py is a piece of code containing the potential expression, which is used in compute-v6-gen.py and compute-v8.py 
	it is generated by analytic-output-c++python.nb

main.nb\For-Alpha123Beta123-plots:
	this part of code generates inputs and writes into scan-a123b123-data/input*.h5 
	then invokes compute-a123b123.py to compute the samples in scan-a123b123-data/input*.h5, the output is in scan-a123b123-data/result*.h5;
	then the mathematica code proceeds to deal with these samples and make those plots.

main.nb\For-m11m22-plots:

	similar as the above part, except for m11m22 plots,
	it invokes compute-mass.py and the data is in scan-mass-data/input*.h5 and scan-mass-data/result*.h5
